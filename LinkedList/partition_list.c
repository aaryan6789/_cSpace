/* LeetCode M | CTCI M
 * Partition List
 * Given a linked list and a value x,
 * partition it such that all nodes less than x come before nodes
 * greater than or equal to x.
 *
 * NOTE: You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each
 * of the two partitions.
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: head = 1->4->3->2->5->2, x = 3
 * Output: 1->2->2->4->3->5
 */

/* 1. Create 2 different Linked Lists: smaller and greater
 * 		1. For elements less then value X		--> on smaller
 * 		2. For elements more than value X		--> on greater
 * 2. Iterate through the list,
 * 		insert the element in the head if node->data < x
 * 		insert the element in the tail if node->data > x
 * 3. Once we reach to the end of the list, merge the 2 lists

/**
 * partition_list - Partition a linked List around a value X.

 * Algorithm:
 * 1. Create 2 different Linked Lists: head and tail
 * 		1. For elements less then value X		--> on Head
 * 		2. For elements more than value X		--> on tail
 * 2. Iterate through the list,
 * 		insert the element in the head if node->data < x
 * 		insert the element in the tail if node->data > x
 * 3. Once we reach to the end of the list, merge the 2 lists
 * 		head->next = tail;
